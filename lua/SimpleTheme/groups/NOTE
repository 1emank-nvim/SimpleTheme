Definitions of groups in this folder are from the Nvim `:help`.

I made this plugin in a day, so I haven't looked up yet licencing stuff.
So, if I'm infringing a license because I'm not copying some file or crediting
the author in some specific way:

I'm sorry :(
I'll fix it.

Beause of the nature of this little plugin and nvim being open source I doubt I
would get in any trouble even if it's used by millions, but I want to do things
the right way :D
